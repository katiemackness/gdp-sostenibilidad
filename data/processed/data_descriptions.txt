Notes:

- All monetary values are in constant USD for comparability.
- Log and winsorized columns are included to support robust statistical analysis.
- Outlier columns are based on z-score thresholds.
- Categories are based on quantiles or World Bank definitions.
- The dataset is suitable for time series, cross-sectional, and panel analysis.
